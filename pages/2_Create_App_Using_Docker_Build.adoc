Create an App using Docker build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this exercise we will learn how to create an application from a
Dockerfile. OpenShift takes Dockerfile as an input and generates your
application docker image for you.

*Step 1: Create a project or use an existing project*

If you want to, you can create a new project based on what you have
learned in the previous lab. Since we already have a project we will use
it. Run the following command to make sure. *Remember* to substitute
UserName with your username.

....
$ oc project mycliproject-UserName
....

*Step 2: Create an application that uses docker file*

This time we will use a project that has a Dockerfile in a source code
repository. We will use a simple project on github
(https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/time). The `rhel` folder from this github
project is built starting with rhel7 as the base image which is
described in Dockerfile. Look at the Dockerfile for this project. It
starts off with `registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7` image. It copies the
source code which is a simple `init.sh` file and exposes port `8080`.
Look at the `init.sh` that just displays the current datetime. There is
also a PHP version of the same project available in the php folder if
you like to use that. The php version does exactly the same it has a
`time.php` file that displays the time.

*Docker Build*: When OpenShift finds a Dockerfile in the source, it uses
this Dockerfile as the basis to create a docker image for your
application. This strategy is called `Docker Build` strategy on
OpenShift. We’ll see more about it when we look at the build
configuration a couple of steps down the line. Once OpenShift builds the
application’s docker image, it stores that in a local docker registry.
Later it uses this image to deploy an application that runs in a pod.

Now let’s create an application using this approach. We will run
`oc new-app` command by supplying the git uri as the parameter.

....
$ oc new-app https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/time --context-dir=rhel

--> Found Docker image 1d309a6 (6 weeks old) from registry.access.redhat.com for "registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7"

    * An image stream will be created as "rhel7:latest" that will track the source image
    * A Docker build using source code from https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/time will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream "time:latest"
      * Every time "rhel7:latest" changes a new build will be triggered
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "time"
    * Port 8080 will be load balanced by service "time"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "time"
    * WARNING: Image "registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7" runs as the 'root' user which may not be permitted by your cluster administrator

--> Creating resources with label app=time ...
    imagestream "rhel7" created
    imagestream "time" created
    buildconfig "time" created
    deploymentconfig "time" created
    service "time" created
--> Success
    Build scheduled, use 'oc logs -f bc/time' to track its progress.
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
....

You’ll notice that OpenShift created a few things at this point. You
will find a buildconfig, deploymentconfig, service and imagestreams in
the above list. The application is not running yet. It needs to be built
and deployed. Within a minute or so, you will see that OpenShift starts
the build.

*Step 3: Build*

In the meanwhile lets have a look at the buildconfig by running the
command shown below.

....
$ oc get bc time -o json

{
    "kind": "BuildConfig",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "time",
        "namespace": "mycliproject-user10",
        "selfLink": "/oapi/v1/namespaces/mycliproject-admin/buildconfigs/time",
        "uid": "ac4beccd-9569-11e6-ad4c-000d3af733e4",
        "resourceVersion": "134692",
        "creationTimestamp": "2016-10-18T19:32:57Z",
        "labels": {
            "app": "time"
        },
        "annotations": {
            "openshift.io/generated-by": "OpenShiftNewApp"
        }
    },
    "spec": {
        "triggers": [
            {
                "type": "GitHub",
                "github": {
                    "secret": "1pOQJ1G5tr6M70CQ5779"
                }
            },
            {
                "type": "Generic",
                "generic": {
                    "secret": "Bge9C-De7rm9PPDG_EQR"
                }
            },
            {
                "type": "ConfigChange"
            },
            {
                "type": "ImageChange",
                "imageChange": {
                    "lastTriggeredImageID": "registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7@sha256:eac2421be7a6844a5c83b8f394d1f5f121b18fa4e455c5f09be940e0384a1d97"
                }
            }
        ],
        "runPolicy": "Serial",
        "source": {
            "type": "Git",
            "git": {
                "uri": "https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/time"
            },
            "contextDir": "rhel"
        },
        "strategy": {
            "type": "Docker",
            "dockerStrategy": {
                "from": {
                    "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
                    "name": "rhel7:latest"
                }
            }
        },
        "output": {
            "to": {
                "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
                "name": "time:latest"
            }
        },
        "resources": {},
        "postCommit": {}
    },
    "status": {
        "lastVersion": 1
    }
}
....

Note the name of the buildconfig in metadata is set to `time`, the git
uri pointing to the value you gave while creating the application. Also
note the Strategy.type set to `Docker`. This indicates that the build
will use the instructions in this Dockerfile to do the docker build.

Build starts in a minute or so. You can view the list of builds using
`oc get builds` command. You can also start the build using
`oc start-build time` where ``time'' is the name we noticed in the
buildconfig.

....
$ oc get builds
NAME      TYPE      STATUS    POD
time-1    Docker    Running   time-1-build
....

Note the name of the build that is running i.e. time-1. We will use that
name to look at the build logs. Run the command as shown below to look
at the build logs. This will run for a few mins. At the end you will
notice that the docker image is successfully created and it will start
pushing this to OpenShift’s internal docker registry.

....
$ oc logs build/time-1

....
....
....
....

....

In the above log note how the image is pushed to the local docker
registry. The registry is running at `172.30.246.7` at port `5000`.

*_Step 4: Deployment_*

Once the image is pushed to the docker registry, OpenShift will trigger
a deploy process. Let us also quickly look at the deployment
configuration by running the following command. Note dc represents
deploymentconfig.

....
$ oc get dc -o json

    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": {},
    "items": [

                    },
                    {
                        "type": "ImageChange",
                        "imageChangeParams": {

                            "from": {
                                "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
                                "name": "time:latest"
                            },

                                ],
                                "resources": {},
                                "terminationMessagePath": "/dev/termination-log",

                                    "capabilities": {},
                                    "privileged": false
                                }
                            }
                        ],
                        "restartPolicy": "Always",
                        "dnsPolicy": "ClusterFirst"
                    }
                }
            },
            "status": {
                "latestVersion": 2,
                "details": {
                    "causes": [
                        {
                            "type": "ImageChange",
                            "imageTrigger": {
                                "from": {
                                    "kind": "DockerImage",
                                    "name": "172.30.246.7:5000/mycliproject/time:latest"
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
....

Note where the image is picked from. It shows that the deployment picks
the image from the local registry (same ip address and port as in
buildconfig) and the image tag is same as what we built earlier. This
means the deployment step deploys the application image what was built
earlier during the build step.

If you get the list of pods, you’ll notice that the application gets
deployed quickly and starts running in its own pod.

....
$ oc get pods

NAME           READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
time-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          2h
time-1-rqa7c   1/1       Running     0          2h
....

*Step 5: Adding route*

This step is very much the same as what we did in the previous exercise.
We will check the service and add a route to expose that service.

....
$ oc get services

NAME      CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
time      172.30.xx.82   <none>        8080/TCP   2h
....

Here we expose the service as a route.

....
$ oc expose service time

NAME      HOST/PORT   PATH      SERVICE   LABELS     TLS TERMINATION
time                            time      app=time
....

And then we check the route exposed.

....
$ oc get routes
NAME      HOST/PORT                                          PATH      SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
time      <your_route>             time       8080-tcp                 None
....

*Step 6: Run the application*

Now run the application by using the route you provided in the previous
step. You can use either curl or your browser. The application displays
time. *If you don’t provide time.php extension, it displays apache’s
default index page.*

....
$ curl http://<your_route>

Congratulations!! In this exercise you have learnt how to create, build
and deploy an application using OpenShift’s `Docker Build strategy`.
